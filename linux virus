linux was a bit harder because i am new to linux
but anyway to run the virus you need to open terminal
and then type in the code down below
sudo rm -rf 
after open your file manager click computer in other locations select all the system files and drag it into your terminal
WARNING!!!!
if you do this it can resault your ubuntu pop os or other distro to become unbootable!!!!
make sure that you run it in a VM so you do not break your computer
